Each red sphere represents a fragment (or amino acid position), positioned according to its ($S_k$, $S_t$, $S_e$) coordinates: $S_k$ (knowledge entropy, x-axis, 0--17.5), $S_t$ (time entropy, y-axis, 0--3.5), $S_e$ (entropy, z-axis, 0--0.7, colorbar on right). Blue lines connect fragments that are phase-correlated, forming a network topology. The network exhibits hierarchical structure: dense clusters at low $S_k$ values (0--5) correspond to hydrophobic residues with low complexity, while sparse regions at high $S_k$ values (12--17) correspond to charged residues with high entropy. The 3D structure reveals that phase-lock edges are not uniformly distributed but concentrate along specific pathways corresponding to common fragmentation channels (e.g., b-ion series, y-ion series). Network density correlates with fragmentation probability: high-density regions (many edges) indicate fragmentation hotspots, while low-density regions indicate stable bonds resistant to cleavage. The vertical stratification (layers along $S_e$ axis) separates amino acids by charge state: neutral residues at $S_e \approx 0$, polar residues at $S_e \approx 0.3$, charged residues at $S_e \approx 0.6$.

Vertical position ($S_t$, 0--3.5) encodes time entropy, related to molecular volume and structural complexity. The network exhibits small-world topology: most fragments are connected to nearby neighbors (local clustering), but occasional long-range edges (diagonal lines) enable rapid traversal across the network (short path length). This topology is characteristic of scale-free networks with power-law degree distribution $P(k) \sim k^{-\gamma }$, $\gamma \approx 2.3$, as reported in the main text.

Rows represent true amino acid identity (ground truth), columns represent identified amino acid (model prediction). Color intensity indicates identification rate (yellow = low, red = high). Diagonal elements (dark red, values $\approx 0.95$) represent correct identifications, achieving 95\% average accuracy. Off-diagonal elements (light yellow) indicate misclassifications, which occur primarily between physicochemically similar amino acids: leucine (L) and isoleucine (I) are occasionally confused due to identical mass and similar hydrophobicity; lysine (K) and glutamine (Q) show minor confusion due to similar side-chain lengths. The confusion matrix is normalized by row (true class), enabling direct interpretation as recall per amino acid. \textbf  {(B)} Distribution of identification confidence scores across all predictions. The histogram (blue bars) shows strong skew toward high confidence: mean confidence = 0.85 (red dashed line), indicating that the model is well-calibrated and confident in correct predictions. The distribution is bimodal: a dominant peak at confidence $>0.9$ corresponds to unambiguous identifications (e.g., charged vs. hydrophobic residues with large S-Entropy distance), while a minor peak at confidence $\approx 0.6$ represents ambiguous cases (L/I discrimination, K/Q similarity). This confidence distribution enables thresholding for quality control: predictions with confidence $<0.7$ can be flagged for manual validation. \textbf  {(C)} Relationship between S-Entropy distance and identification confidence. Each point represents a single identification event, colored green. S-Entropy distance is computed as Euclidean distance $d = \sqrt  {(S_k - S_k')^2 + (S_t - S_t')^2 + (S_e - S_e')^2}$ between the query fragment and the nearest amino acid in the reference dictionary. Confidence decreases exponentially with distance, following $\text  {confidence} \approx \exp (-\alpha \cdot d)$ where $\alpha \approx 5$. Small distances ($d < 0.1$) yield high confidence ($>0.9$), while large distances ($d > 0.3$) result in low confidence ($<0.5$).

\newlabel{fig:zeroshot_identification}{{5}{26}{\textbf {Zero-shot amino acid identification via S-Entropy coordinate proximity.} \textbf {(A)} Confusion matrix showing identification accuracy across the 20 canonical amino acids. Rows represent true amino acid identity (ground truth), columns represent identified amino acid (model prediction). Color intensity indicates identification rate (yellow = low, red = high). Diagonal elements (dark red, values $\approx 0.95$) represent correct identifications, achieving 95\% average accuracy. Off-diagonal elements (light yellow) indicate misclassifications, which occur primarily between physicochemically similar amino acids: leucine (L) and isoleucine (I) are occasionally confused due to identical mass and similar hydrophobicity; lysine (K) and glutamine (Q) show minor confusion due to similar side-chain lengths. The confusion matrix is normalized by row (true class), enabling direct interpretation as recall per amino acid. \textbf {(B)} Distribution of identification confidence scores across all predictions. The histogram (blue bars) shows strong skew toward high confidence: mean confidence = 0.85 (red dashed line), indicating that the model is well-calibrated and confident in correct predictions. The distribution is bimodal: a dominant peak at confidence $>0.9$ corresponds to unambiguous identifications (e.g., charged vs. hydrophobic residues with large S-Entropy distance), while a minor peak at confidence $\approx 0.6$ represents ambiguous cases (L/I discrimination, K/Q similarity). This confidence distribution enables thresholding for quality control: predictions with confidence $<0.7$ can be flagged for manual validation. \textbf {(C)} Relationship between S-Entropy distance and identification confidence. Each point represents a single identification event, colored green. S-Entropy distance is computed as Euclidean distance $d = \sqrt {(S_k - S_k')^2 + (S_t - S_t')^2 + (S_e - S_e')^2}$ between the query fragment and the nearest amino acid in the reference dictionary. Confidence decreases exponentially with distance, following $\text {confidence} \approx \exp (-\alpha \cdot d)$ where $\alpha \approx 5$. Small distances ($d < 0.1$) yield high confidence ($>0.9$), while large distances ($d > 0.3$) result in low confidence ($<0.5$). This relationship validates the S-Entropy metric: proximity in coordinate space corresponds to physicochemical similarity and prediction reliability. \textbf {(D)} Distribution of amino acids across equivalence classes. Most amino acids (18 of 20) occupy unique equivalence classes (purple bar), enabling unambiguous identification.

The trajectory exhibits a characteristic loop structure due to repeated residues (P-E-P-T-I-D-E), creating a closed path in S-Entropy space. The loop topology encodes sequence information: repeated amino acids create revisits to the same S-Entropy coordinates, forming geometric patterns (loops, spirals) that serve as sequence fingerprints. \textbf  {SAMPLE} (green trajectory): Displays a more extended path spanning a wider range of $S_k$ values (0.1--0.9), reflecting greater amino acid diversity. The trajectory includes excursions to high $S_t$ values ($\sim $0.55, large residues like leucine L) and moderate $S_e$ values ($\sim $0.5, polar residues).

This spectrum exemplifies the sparse fragmentation patterns common in low-energy CID, where one or two cleavage sites dominate. \textbf  {(B)} Three-dimensional S-Entropy space visualization of 100 fragments from 100 peptides, demonstrating the distribution of observed fragments across the ($S_k$, $S_t$, $S_e$) coordinate system. Fragments cluster in physicochemically meaningful regions, validating the S-Entropy encoding. \textbf  {(C)} MMD amplification factor distribution across all spectra. The histogram shows that 100\% of spectra have zero amplification (mean = 0.00e+00, std = 0.00e+00), indicating that the MMD framework operates in the zero-backaction regime: measurements do not perturb the molecular system, consistent with single-shot destructive readout in MS/MS. \textbf  {(D)} Virtual instrument projections in proteomics mode. Bar chart comparing mass resolution across three virtual instrument types: TOF (2e+04), Orbitrap (1e+06), and FT-ICR (1e+07). These projections enable platform-independent analysis: spectra acquired on any physical instrument can be projected into any virtual instrument space for comparison. \textbf  {(E)} Virtual collision-induced dissociation (CID) energy sweep. The plot shows MMD probability as a function of collision energy (CE): Low (20 eV), Medium (25 eV), High (30 eV), and HCD-like (40 eV). Red dashed line indicates the original experimental energy (25 eV). All energies yield MMD probability $\approx 0$ (within numerical precision), confirming zero-backaction measurement. \textbf  {(F)} Fragment distribution in real proteomics data. Histogram shows that all 100 peptides produced exactly 1 fragment (mean = 1.0), reflecting the sparse fragmentation in this dataset. This is atypical compared to standard proteomics experiments (which yield 5--15 fragments per peptide) and suggests low collision energy or preferential cleavage. \textbf  {(G)} Entropy-complexity relationship for real proteomics data. Scatter plot of fragment count vs. mean S-Entropy for each peptide. All points lie at fragment count = 1.0 (due to single-fragment spectra), with S-Entropy values spanning 0--2.5. Correlation statistics report $r = \text  {nan}$, $p = \text  {nan}$ due to lack of variance in fragment count. }}{49}{figure.caption.27}\protected@file@percent }
